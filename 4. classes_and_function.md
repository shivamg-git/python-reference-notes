* ###   How to write an empty function in Python - pass statement?
```python
# Correct way of writing empty function 
# in Python
def fun(): 
    pass

# Empty loop in Python
mutex = True
while (mutex == True) :
    pass

# Empty in if/else in Python
mutex = True
if (mutex == True) :
    pass
else :
    print("False")
```

* ### When to use yield instead of return in Python?

The yield statement suspends function's execution and sends a value back to caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather them computing them at once and sending them back like a list.

```python
# A Simple Python program to demonstrate working
# of yield

# A generator function that yields 1 for first time,
# 2 second time and 3 third time
def simpleGeneratorFun():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

# Driver code to check above generator function
for value in simpleGeneratorFun(): 
    print(value)


#OUTPUT
1
2
3
```
Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don't want to store the entire sequence in memory.

Yield are used in Python generators. A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.

```python
# A Python program to generate squares from 1
# to 100 using yield and therefore generator

# An infinite generator function that prints
# next square number. It starts with 1
def nextSquare():
    i = 1;

    # An Infinite loop to generate squares 
    while True:
        yield i*i                
        i += 1  # Next execution resumes 
                # from this point     

# Driver code to test above generator 
# function
for num in nextSquare():
    if num > 100:
         break    
    print(num)

#OUTPUT
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
```

* ### Python Module
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.

```python
# importing  module calc.py
import calc

print add(10, 2)
```
```python
# importing sqrt() and factorial from the 
# module math
from math import sqrt, factorial

# if we simply do "import math", then
# math.sqrt(16) and math.factorial()
# are required.
print sqrt(16)
print factorial(6)
```

The **dir()** function The dir() built-in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined by a module. The list contains the names of all the modules, variables and functions that are defined in a module.

```python
#  Import built-in module  random
import  random
print  dir(math)

#OUTPUT
['BPF', 'LOG4', 'NV_MAGICCONST', 'RECIP_BPF', 'Random', 
'SG_MAGICCONST', 'SystemRandom', 'TWOPI', 'WichmannHill', 
'_BuiltinMethodType', '_MethodType', '__all__', 
'__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', 
'__package__', '_acos', '_ceil', '_cos', '_e', '_exp', 
'_hashlib', '_hexlify', '_inst', '_log', '_pi', '_random',
'_sin', '_sqrt', '_test', '_test_generator', '_urandom',
'_warn', 'betavariate', 'choice', 'division', 
'expovariate', 'gammavariate', 'gauss', 'getrandbits',
'getstate', 'jumpahead', 'lognormvariate', 'normalvariate',
'paretovariate', 'randint', 'random', 'randrange', 
'sample', 'seed', 'setstate', 'shuffle', 'triangular', 
'uniform', 'vonmisesvariate', 'weibullvariate']
```

```python
# importing built-in module math
import math

# using square root(sqrt) function contained 
# in math module
print math.sqrt(25) 

# using pi function contained in math module
print math.pi 

# 2 radians = 114.59 degreees
print math.degrees(2) 

# 60 degrees = 1.04 radians
print math.radians(60) 

# Sine of 2 radians
print math.sin(2) 

# Cosine of 0.5 radians
print math.cos(0.5) 

# Tangent of 0.23 radians
print math.tan(0.23)

# 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
print math.factorial(4) 

# importing built in module random
import random

# printing random integer between 0 and 5
print random.randint(0, 5) 

# print random floating point number between 0 and 1
print random.random() 

# random number between 0 and 100
print random.random() * 100 

List = [1, 4, True, 800, "python", 27, "hello"]

# using choice function in random module for choosing 
# a random element from a set such as a list
print random.choice(List)

# importing built in module datetime
import datetime
from datetime import date
import time

# Returns the number of seconds since the
# Unix Epoch, January 1st 1970
print time.time() 

# Converts a number of seconds to a date object
print date.fromtimestamp(454554) 
```

# Object Oriented Programming in Python

### (Class, Object and Members)
```python
# A simple example class 
class Test: 
      
    # A sample method  
    def fun(self): 
        print("Hello") 
  
# Driver code 
obj = Test() 
obj.fun()
```
**The self**
* Class methods must have an extra first parameter in method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it

* If we have a method which takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument â€“ the self. See fun() in above simple example.

* This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.

**The \_\_init__ method**<br>
The \_\_init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.


```python
# A Sample class with init method 
class Person: 

	# init method or constructor 
	def __init__(self, name): 
		self.name = name 

	# Sample Method 
	def say_hi(self): 
		print('Hello, my name is', self.name) 

p = Person('Shwetanshu') 
p.say_hi() 
```
**Class and Instance Variables (Or attributes)**

```python
# Python program to show that the variables with a value 
# assigned in class declaration, are class variables and 
# variables inside methods and constructors are instance 
# variables. 

# Class for Computer Science Student 
class CSStudent: 

	# Class Variable 
	stream = 'cse'			

	# The init method or constructor 
	def __init__(self, roll): 
	
		# Instance Variable	 
		self.roll = roll	 

# Objects of CSStudent class 
a = CSStudent(101) 
b = CSStudent(102) 

print(a.stream) # prints "cse" 
print(b.stream) # prints "cse" 
print(a.roll) # prints 101 

# Class variables can be accessed using class 
# name also 
print(CSStudent.stream) # prints "cse"	 
```
```python
# Python program to show that we can create  
# instance variables inside methods 
   
# Class for Computer Science Student 
class CSStudent: 
      
    # Class Variable 
    stream = 'cse'      
      
    # The init method or constructor 
    def __init__(self, roll): 
          
        # Instance Variable 
        self.roll = roll             
  
    # Adds an instance variable  
    def setAddress(self, address): 
        self.address = address 
      
    # Retrieves instance variable     
    def getAddress(self):     
        return self.address    
  
# Driver Code 
a = CSStudent(101) 
a.setAddress("Noida, UP") 
print(a.getAddress())  
```
* How to create a Empty class.
```python
# An empty class 
class Test: 
    pass
```
---
### (Data Hiding and Object Printing)

* Data hiding<br>
In Python, we use double underscore (Or __) before the attributes name and those attributes will not be directly visible outside.
```python
class MyClass:
  
    # Hidden member of MyClass 
    __hiddenVariable = 0
    
    # A member method that changes  
    # __hiddenVariable  
    def add(self, increment): 
        self.__hiddenVariable += increment 
        print (self.__hiddenVariable) 
   
# Driver code 
myObject = MyClass()      
myObject.add(2) 
myObject.add(5) 
  
# This line causes error 
print (myObject.__hiddenVariable) 
```
trick to access private member outside

```python
# A Python program to demonstrate that hidden 
# members can be accessed outside a class 
class MyClass: 
  
    # Hidden member of MyClass 
    __hiddenVariable = 10
  
# Driver code 
myObject = MyClass()      
print(myObject._MyClass__hiddenVariable) 
```
Private methods are accessible outside their class, just not easily accessible. **Nothing in Python is truly private; internally,*** the names of private methods and attributes are mangled and unmangled on the fly to make them seem inaccessible by their given names

* **Printing Objects**
```python
class Test: 
    def __init__(self, a, b): 
        self.a = a 
        self.b = b 
  
    def __repr__(self): 
        return "Test a:%s b:%s" % (self.a, self.b) 
  
    def __str__(self): 
        return "From str method of Test: a is %s," \ 
              "b is %s" % (self.a, self.b) 
  
# Driver Code         
t = Test(1234, 5678) 
print(t) # This calls __str__() 
print([t]) # This calls __repr__() 

#OUTPUT
From str method of Test: a is 1234,b is 5678
[Test a:1234 b:5678]
```
#### Important Points about Printing:

* If no __str__ method is defined, print t (or print str(t)) uses __repr__.
```python
class Test: 
    def __init__(self, a, b): 
        self.a = a 
        self.b = b 
  
    def __repr__(self): 
        return "Test a:%s b:%s" % (self.a, self.b)   
# Driver Code         
t = Test(1234, 5678) 
print(t)  

#Output :
Test a:1234 b:5678
```
* If no __repr__ method is defined then the default is used.
```python
class Test: 
    def __init__(self, a, b): 
        self.a = a 
        self.b = b 
  
# Driver Code         
t = Test(1234, 5678) 
print(t)  

#Output :
<__main__.Test instance at 0x7fa079da6710>
```

### (Inheritance, examples of object, issubclass and super)
* Python program to show how inheritance is implemented in Python.
```python
# A Python program to demonstrate inheritance 

# Base or Super class. Note object in bracket.
# (Generally, object is made ancestor of all classes)
# In Python 3.x "class Person" is 
# equivalent to "class Person(object)"
class Person(object):
    
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # To get name
    def getName(self):
        return self.name

    # To check if this person is employee
    def isEmployee(self):
        return False


# Inherited or Sub class (Note Person in bracket)
class Employee(Person):

    # Here we return true
    def isEmployee(self):
        return True

# Driver code
emp = Person("Geek1")  # An Object of Person
print(emp.getName(), emp.isEmployee())

emp = Employee("Geek2") # An Object of Employee
print(emp.getName(), emp.isEmployee())
```

```python
# Python example to check if a class is
# subclass of another

class Base(object):
    pass   # Empty Class

class Derived(Base):
    pass   # Empty Class

# Driver Code
print(issubclass(Derived, Base))
print(issubclass(Base, Derived))

d = Derived()
b = Base()

# b is not an instance of Derived
print(isinstance(b, Derived))

# But d is an instance of Base
print(isinstance(d, Base))
```

**Does Python support Multiple Inheritance?** Unlike Java and like C++, Python supports multiple inheritance. We specify all parent classes as comma separated list in bracket.

```python
# Python example to show working of multiple 
# inheritance
class Base1(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.str1 = "Geek1"
        print "Base1"

class Base2(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.str2 = "Geek2"        
        print "Base2"

class Derived(Base1, Base2):
    def __init__(self):
        
        # Calling constructors of Base1
        # and Base2 classes
        Base1.__init__(self)
        Base2.__init__(self)
        print "Derived"
        
    def printStrs(self):
        print(self.str1, self.str2)
       

ob = Derived()
ob.printStrs()
```

How to access parent members in a subclass?
1. **Using Parent class name**
```python
# Python example to show that base
# class members can be accessed in
# derived class using base class name
class Base(object):

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x    

class Derived(Base):

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        Base.x = x 
        self.y = y

    def printXY(self):
     
       # print(self.x, self.y) will also work
       print(Base.x, self.y)


# Driver Code
d = Derived(10, 20)
d.printXY()
```
2. **Using super()**
```python
# Python example to show that base
# class members can be accessed in
# derived class using super()
class Base(object):

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x    

class Derived(Base):

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        
        ''' In Python 3.x, "super().__init__(name)"
            also works''' 
        super(Derived, self).__init__(x)
        self.y = y

    def printXY(self):

       # Note that Base.x won't work here
       # because super() is used in constructor
       print(self.x, self.y)


# Driver Code
d = Derived(10, 20)
d.printXY()
```

**Note:** that the above two methods are not exactly the same. In the next article on inheritance, we will covering following topics.
1) How super works? How accessing a member through super and parent class name are different?
2) How Diamond problem is handled in Python?

###   Class or Static Variables in Python
Class or static variables are shared by all objects. Instance or non-static variables are different for different objects (every object has a copy of it).
For example, let a Computer Science Student be represented by class CSStudent.

The class may have a static variable whose value is "cse" for all objects. And class may also have non-static members like name and roll.

In C++ and Java, we can use static keyword to make a variable as class variable. The variables which don't have preceding static keyword are instance variables. See this for Java example and this for C++ example.

The Python approach is simple, it doesn't require a static keyword. All variables which are assigned a value in class declaration are class variables. And variables which are assigned values inside class methods are instance variables.

```python
# Python program to show that the variables with a value 
# assigned in class declaration, are class variables

# Class for Computer Science Student
class CSStudent:
    stream = 'cse'                  # Class Variable
    def __init__(self,name,roll):
        self.name = name            # Instance Variable
        self.roll = roll            # Instance Variable

# Objects of CSStudent class
a = CSStudent('Geek', 1)
b = CSStudent('Nerd', 2)

print(a.stream)  # prints "cse"
print(b.stream)  # prints "cse"
print(a.name)    # prints "Geek"
print(b.name)    # prints "Nerd"
print(a.roll)    # prints "1"
print(b.roll)    # prints "2"

# Class variables can be accessed using class
# name also
print(CSStudent.stream) # prints "cse"

#OUTPUT
cse
cse
Geek
Nerd
1
2
cse
```

### Python lambda (Anonymous Functions) | filter, map, reduce

```python
# Python code to illustrate cube of a number 
# showing difference between def() and lambda().
def cube(y):
    return y*y*y;

g = lambda x: x*x*x
print(g(7))

print(cube(5))
```
* Use of lambda() with filter()

```python
# filter() with lambda()
li = [5, 7, 22, 97, 54, 62, 77, 23, 73, 61]
final_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 != 0) , li))
print(final_list)
```
* Use of lambda() with map()

```python
# map() with lambda() 
# to get double of a list.
li = [5, 7, 22, 97, 54, 62, 77, 23, 73, 61]
final_list = list(map(lambda x: x*2 , li))
print(final_list)
```
* Use of lambda() with reduce()

```python
# reduce() with lambda()
# to get sum of a list
from functools import reduce
li = [5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100]
sum = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), li)
print (sum)
```
