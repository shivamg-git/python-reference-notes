# Python Basics
---
* Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
* Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program's users.
* Dynamically Typed
	1. No need to declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type.
	2. No type casting required when using container objects	
* Concise Express much in limited words
* Compact
* Uses Indentation for structuring code

## Softwares making use of Python
### 	Python has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a 	scripting language.
1. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers.
2. Python has also been used in artificial intelligence
3. Python is often used for natural language processing tasks.

### 	Current Applications of Python
1. A number of Linux distributions use installers written in Python example in Ubuntu we have the Ubiquity
2. Python has seen extensive use in the information security industry, including in exploit development.
3. Raspberry Piâ€“ single board computer uses Python as its principal user-programming language.
4. Python is now being used Game Development areas also.

#### Pros:
* Ease of use
* Multi-paradigm Approach
#### Cons:
* Slow speed of execution compared to C,C++
* Absence from mobile computing and browsers
* For the C,C++ programmers switching to python can be irritating as the language requires proper 		indentation of code. Certain variable names commonly used like sum are functions in python. So C, C++ programmers have to look out for these.
####  Industrial Importance:
* Most of the companies are now looking for candidates who know about Python Programming. Those having the knowledge of python may have more chances of impressing the interviewing panel. 	So I would suggest that beginners should start learning python and excel in it.

### Python 3 Basics

**Variables and Data Structures**

```python
# Python program to declare variables
myNumber = 3
print(myNumber)
myNumber2 = 4.5
print(myNumber2)
myNumber = "helloworld"
print(myNumber)
```
**Python have 4 types of built in Data Structures namely List,Dictionary, Tuple and Set.**

```python
# Python program to illustrate list 
# creates a empty list
nums = [] 
# appending data in list
nums.append(21)
nums.append(40.5)
nums.append("String")
print(nums)
```

**Input and Output**
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
# user entered the name 'harssh'
print("hello", name)
```
**Selection**
```python
num1 = 34
if(num1>12):
    print("Num1 is good")
elif(num1>35):
    print("Num2 is not gooooo....")
else:
    print("Num2 is great")
```

**Function**
```python
def hello():
    print("hello")
    print("hello again")
hello()

# calling function
hello()  
```

```python
# Python program to illustrate 
# function with main
def getInteger():
    result = int(input("Enter integer: "))
    return result

def Main():
    print("Started")
# calling the getInteger function and 
# storing its returned value in the output variable
    output = getInteger()     
    print(output)

# now we are required to tell Python 
# for 'Main' function existence
if __name__=="__main__":
    Main()
```

**Iterator**
```python
for step in range(5):    
    print(step)
```

**Module**
```python
# math module
import math

def Main():
    num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    # fabs is used to get the absolute value of a decimal
    num = math.fabs(num) 
    print(num)
if __name__=="__main__":
    Main()
```
---
### Basic Operation
1. **Arithmetic operators**

```python
# Addition of numbers
add = a + b
# Subtraction of numbers 
sub = a - b
# Multiplication of number 
mul = a * b
# Division(float) of number 
div1 = a / b
# Division(floor) of number 
div2 = a // b
# Modulo of both number
mod = a % b
```

2. **Relational Operators**
```python
# Examples of Relational Operators
a = 13
b = 33
# a > b is False
print(a > b)
# a < b is True
print(a < b)
# a == b is False
print(a == b)
# a != b is True
print(a != b)
# a >= b is False
print(a >= b)
# a <= b is True
print(a <= b)
```

3. **Logical Operations
```python
# Examples of Logical Operator
a = True
b = False

# Print a and b is False
print(a and b)
# Print a or b is True
print(a or b)
# Print not a is False
print(not a)
```
4. **Bitwise Operations**

```python
# Examples of Bitwise operators
a = 10
b = 4

# Print bitwise AND operation  
print(a & b)
# Print bitwise OR operation
print(a | b)
# Print bitwise NOT operation 
print(~a)
# print bitwise XOR operation 
print(a ^ b)
# print bitwise right shift operation 
print(a >> 2)
# print bitwise left shift operation 
print(a << 2)
```
5. **Assignment operators**

```pytohn
a  =  10
a +=  20
a -=  20
a *=  20
a /=  20
a %=  20
a //= 20
a **= 20
a &=  20
a |=  20
a ^=  20
a <<= 10
a >>= 10
```

6. **Special operators**
* Identity operators
```python
# Examples of Identity operators
a1 = 3
b1 = 3
a2 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
b2 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
a3 = [1,2,3]
b3 = [1,2,3]
print(a1 is not b1)
print(a2 is b2)
# Output is False, since lists are mutable.
print(a3 is b3)
```
* Membership operators
```python
# Examples of Membership operator
x = 'Geeks for Geeks'
y = {3:'a',4:'b'}
print('G' in x)
print('geeks' not in x)
print('Geeks' not in x)
print(3 in y)
print('b' in y)
```
---
### Ternary Operation

1. **Simple Method**
```python
# Program to demonstrate conditional operator
a, b = 10, 20
# Copy value of a in min if a < b else copy b
min = a if a < b else b
print(min)
```

2. **Direct Method by using tuples, Dictionary and lambda**
```python
# Python program to demonstrate ternary operator
a, b = 10, 20

# Use tuple for selecting an item
print( (b, a) [a < b] )

# Use Dictionary for selecting an item
print({True: a, False: b} [a < b])

# lamda is more efficient than above two methods
# because in lambda  we are assure that
# only one expression will be evaluated unlike in
# tuple and Dictionary
print((lambda: b, lambda: a)[a < b]())
```

3. **Ternary operator can be written as nested if-else:**
```python
# Python program to demonstrate nested ternary operator
a, b = 10, 20
print ("Both a and b are equal" if a == b else "a is greater than b"
        if a > b else "b is greater than a")
```
```python
# Python program to demonstrate nested ternary operator
a, b = 10, 20

if a != b:
    if a > b:
        print("a is greater than b")
    else:
        print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("Both a and b are equal")
```
---
### Division operators
```python
print 5/2			# 2
print -5/2			# -3
print 5.0/2			# 2.5
print -5.0/2			# -2.5
print 5//2			# 2
print -5//2			# -3
print 5.0//2			# -2.0
print -5.0//2			# -3.0
```

### Max possible value in python
```python
# A Python program to demonstrate that we can store
# large numbers in Python

x = 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;
x = x + 1
print (x)
```
```
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```
```python
# A Python program to show that there are two types in
# Python 2.7 : int and long int
# And in Python 3 there is only one type : int

x = 10
print(type(x))

x = 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
print(type(x))
```
```python
# Printing 100 raise to power 100
print(100**100)
```
---
### End in print
```python
print("Welcome to" , end = ' ') 
print("Python" , end = '@')
```
---
### Type Conversion

**int(),float()**
```python
# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using int(), float()

# initializing string
s = "10010"

# printing string converting to int base 2
c = int(s,2)
print ("After converting to integer base 2 : ", end="")
print (c)

# printing string converting to float
e = float(s)
print ("After converting to float : ", end="")
print (e)
```
```
Output:
After converting to integer base 2 : 18
After converting to float : 10010.0
```
**ord(), hex(), oct()**
```python
# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using  ord(), hex(), oct()

# initializing integer
s = '4'

# printing character converting to integer
c = ord(s)
print ("After converting character to integer : ",end="")
print (c)

# printing integer converting to hexadecimal string
c = hex(56)
print ("After converting 56 to hexadecimal string : ",end="")
print (c)

# printing integer converting to octal string
c = oct(56)
print ("After converting 56 to octal string : ",end="")
print (c)
```
```
Output:
After converting character to integer : 52
After converting 56 to hexadecimal string : 0x38
After converting 56 to octal string : 0o70
```

**tuple(), set(), list()**
```python
# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using  tuple(), set(), list()

# initializing string
s = 'geeks'
# printing string converting to tuple
c = tuple(s)
print ("After converting string to tuple : ",end="")
print (c)
# printing string converting to set
c = set(s)
print ("After converting string to set : ",end="")
print (c)
# printing string converting to list
c = list(s)
print ("After converting string to list : ",end="")
print (c)
```
```
Output:
After converting string to tuple : ('g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's')
After converting string to set : {'k', 'e', 's', 'g'}
After converting string to list : ['g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's']
```
**dict(), complex(), str()**
```python
# Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
# using  dict(), complex(), str()

# initializing integers
a = 1
b = 2

# initializing tuple
tup = (('a', 1) ,('f', 2), ('g', 3))
# printing integer converting to complex number
c = complex(1,2)
print ("After converting integer to complex number : ",end="")
print (c)
# printing integer converting to string
c = str(a)
print ("After converting integer to string : ",end="")
print (c)
# printing tuple converting to expression dictionary
c = dict(tup)
print ("After converting tuple to dictionary : ",end="")
print (c)
```
```
Output:
After converting integer to complex number : (1+2j)
After converting integer to string : 1
After converting tuple to dictionary : {'a': 1, 'f': 2, 'g': 3}
```
---
### \_\_name__ special variable
**\_\_name__ is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.**

```python
# File1.py

print "File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__

if __name__ == "__main__":
	print "File1 is being run directly"
else:
	print "File1 is being imported"
```
```python
# File2.py

import File1

print "File2 __name__ = %s" %__name__

if __name__ == "__main__":
	print "File2 is being run directly"
else:
	print "File2 is being imported"
```
```
Output
Now the interpreter is given the command to run File1.py.
python File1.py
Output :
File1 __name__ = __main__
File1 is being run directly

And then File2.py is run.
python File2.py
Output :
File1 __name__ = File1
File1 is being imported
File2 __name__ = __main__
File2 is being run directly
```

## Multiple Input

**Note that in Python 3, we use input() in place of raw_input().**

```python
// Reads two values in one line
scanf("%d %d", &x, &y)
x, y = raw_input(),  raw_input()
x, y = raw_input().split()

# Reads two numbers from input and typecasts them to int using 
# list comprehension
x, y = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]  

# Reads two numbers from input and typecasts them to int using 
# map function
x, y = map(int, raw_input().split())
````
